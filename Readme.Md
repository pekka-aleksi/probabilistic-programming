Probabilistic Programming with PYMC3
===

The purpose of this notebook is to first model the Boston housing dataset (or some other representative dataset) with a simple classical machine learning model and see what results we get.

Then we will do probabilistic programming with PYMC3 and see what inference we can make about that model\results.

This is work in progress.
